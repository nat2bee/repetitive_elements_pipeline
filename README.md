# Pipeline to identify repetitive elements on non model species genomes.

This pipeline is adapted from `Avrilomics` posts (http://avrilomics.blogspot.com/2015/09/creating-merged-repeatmodeler-and.html) and from `Matthew Berriman, Avril Coghlan, Isheng Jason Tsai et al.` (Creation of a comprehensive repeat library for a newly sequenced parasitic worm genome, 15 May 2018, PROTOCOL [Version 1] available at Protocol Exchange [+https://doi.org/10.1038/protex.2018.054+]). The pipeline reasoning is described there. Herein is provided a detailed and update version (Dez 2019) of this protocol using a bee species (*Tetrapedia diversipes*) as example.
